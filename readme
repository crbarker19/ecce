# NOOJIMO - The Indigenous Health Amenities Locator App

## Mission Statement
Canada is considered one of the healthiest nations in the world, but this good health is not shared by all who reside within it. Despite being one of the youngest and fastest-growing groups<sup>1</sup>, our Indigenous population faces grave health inequalities. This includes a lower life expectancy by as much as 15 years, as well as higher rates of infant mortality, suicide, hospitalizations due to mental illness, chronic illnesses, and infectious diseases<sup>2</sup>. The health inequalities experienced have primarily been a result of settler colonialism which displaced First Nations to remote communities that lack resources, amongst other detriments<sup>3</sup>. 

The Waterloo Health Organization aims to respond to this inequality through our application NOOJIMO.  Derived from the Objibwen word for healing<sup>4</sup>, our application takes a holistic approach that incorporates both indigenous and western perspectives on health. With NOOJIMO residents within indigenous communities can more easily access health services and other associated facilities. Nearby health amenities - including hospitals, mental health clinics, healing lodges, and community centres - can be identified based on a user’s location. Once the desired amenity has been identified, directions and estimated travel times are provided. Beyond its benefits to individuals, NOOJIMO can also be used by planners or governing authorities to identify areas with insufficient access to health care, which can in turn inform responsive programs or policy development. 

Through our application, the Waterloo Health Organization aims to support the United Nations’ objective of [reducing inequality](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/report/2020/goal-10/) in its various forms as well as to respond to the [Calls to Action](http://trc.ca/assets/pdf/Calls_to_Action_English2.pdf) identified by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada.


## App Description and Features
The goal of the Waterloo Health Organization's app *NOOJIMO* is to provide a streamlined tool for indigenous communities in Ontario to locate nearby health amenities and services, as they relate to the individual needs of community members. The word *noojimo* comes from the Ojibwe language, meaning to heal and recover from an illness. The simplistic and easy-to-operate web app interface enables a variety of user groups to search for nearby health amenities, depending on their need, and provides directions from point A to point B. The app is tailored to improving health access and reducing inequality, as it offers the ability to search for amenities by reserve, includes many options for traditional and indigenous specific health services, and lists amenity categories in English, French, and Ojibwe. Secondary to its ability to locate health amenities, the app also serves as a tool for policy makers, planners, and developers to identify areas throughout Ontario that lack equal access to healthcare and are in need of improved infrastructure. 

### Functionalities within the *Health Amenities Near Me* Widget
#### Multiple Location Search Options
Unlike other amenity locators, *NOOJIMO* offers the capability to search by reserve, current location, and by dropping a pin using the in-app widget. To search by reserve, simply begin typing the name in the search bar and matching results will begin to appear, in which the user is able to select. The user also has the option of using their current geolocation for the search, or if they prefer, by dropping a pin anywhere in Ontario. For each location search option, the user is able to adjust the search radius buffer by manually typing in a value in the box, or by adjusting the distance slider. If the buffer is too small, no local amenities will be returned, in which case the user may increase the buffer size to expand their search. Additionally, users have the ability to search for nearby health amenities surrounding an amenity of their choice, by clicking the 'Search Nearby' button on the amenity's information tab.

#### Health Services
The app contains a wide variety of health amenities to suite the individual needs of its users. Once the user defines their location, they may browse the local amenities available to them within 12 broad categories: traditional healing and health services, COVID-19 testing centres and pharmacy testing sites, aboriginal health access centres, laboratory testing, senior care, mental health and addiction centres, hospitals, pharmacies, clinics, child and family care, and community service providers. While searching, users can browse available amenities first by category, and then by individual location. Where available, additional information to benefit the user's experience has been included, such as the specific service types (i.e. midwife clinic, healing lodge, etc.), phone numbers, and websites. 

#### Navigation
Once a user has found a nearby amenity that meets their needs, they may select the direction tab to be routed from their search location to the service provider. The direction tab includes information such as the estimated drive time, the option to print, and turns - which can be explored one by one or entirely on the map.
